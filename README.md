Library Management System
A Python-based Library Management System to help manage books, users, and borrowing activities in a library. This project covers basic library functionalities such as adding and displaying books, user management, borrowing and returning books, and even calculating fines for overdue returns. It’s a great example of object-oriented programming, making it perfect for learning and showcasing your skills.

Features
Manage Books: Add new books to the collection and check their availability.
User Management: Register users with unique IDs and track their borrowed books.
Borrowing & Returning Books: Allow users to borrow books (with a due date) and return them.
Fine Calculation: Calculate fines for overdue books based on how many days they’re late.
Usage
Basic Functions
Adding Books: Use addBook("Book Title") to add a book to the library.
Adding Users: Register users with addUser("UserID", "UserName").
Borrowing Books: Borrow a book with borrowBook("Book Title", "UserID"). A due date will be set automatically.
Returning Books: Return a book using returnBook("Book Title", "UserID").
Calculating Fines: To check for overdue fines, use calculateFine("Book Title") to see if a book is late and calculate any fine.
Code Overview
The code revolves around a single Library class that keeps everything organized. Here are some of the main methods:

addBook(title): Adds a book to the library.
showBooks(): Shows all books and their status (available or borrowed).
addUser(user_id, user_name): Registers a new user.
borrowBook(title, user_id): Lets a user borrow a book and sets a due date.
returnBook(title, user_id): Manages the return of a borrowed book.
calculateFine(title): Checks if a book is overdue and calculates a fine if it is.
